# SINEAR
Sinear is a Spring-Boot Angular Demoapplication. 


Install

 Step 1. Import the SINEAR-Backend as existing Mavenproject into your IDE e.q. Eclipse
 
 Step 2. Build the Project
 
 Step 3. Run the Project
 
 
 Step 4. Change with the shell or cmd to the SINEAR-UI folder
 
 Step 5. Run "npm install" (Node JS has to be entered to the enviorenment variables)
 
 Step 6. Run "npx ng serve" (It uses the angular cli out ouf the packges. Alternatively the ng command is added to the enviorenment                variables than just run "ng serve")
 
 
 Step 7. At http://localhost:5000 a Login View should be reachable. (Username: admin | Password: salt)
 
 Step 8. At http://localhost:8080/h2-console the H2-Console should be reachable. (JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:./database/sineardb | User Name: sa            | Password: password ).
 
 
 After login press crtl + q to manually activate the loading spinner (I add this, to show how Hot-Keys work with angular).
 
 I used some HTML and CSS from external soruces for this project. Thx to this guys, I hope there is no copyright on it.
